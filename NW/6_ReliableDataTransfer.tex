\section{Reliable data transfer}
\enumstart
	\item Create a reliable data transfer over a probably unreliable channel
	\item Protocol implements reliability
	\item Reliable data transfer over a reliable channel is trivial
	\item Reliable data transfer over a channel with bit errors and packet loss
	\enumstart
		\item Sender
		\enumstart
			\item Sends packet to receiver with sequence number and checksum
			\item If no valid ACK received in reasonable amount of time: retransmit identical packet
			\item If ACK received: check checksum (if OK then finished else do nothing (wait for timeout))
		\enumend
		\item Receiver
		\enumstart
			\item Receives packet and checks checksum (if OK then ACK else do nothing)
			\item If a packet is retransmitted: ACK again
		\enumend
		\item Optimizations
		\enumstart
			\item NAKs
			\item Send several packets before ACK (generalize alternating bit to "window")
			\item Pipelined protocols (sliding window)
			\enumstart
				\item Go-back-N (multiple-bit sequence number, window of up to N consecutive unacked packets allowed, receiver ACKs all messages at once)
				\item Selective repeat (receiver individually ACKs all packets, window of N consecutive sequence numbers)
