\section{Remote procedure call (RPC)}
\enumstart
	\item Standard for distributed computing
	\item Client can make procedure calls to a software running on another machine
	\item Pointers cannot be passed as parameters \arrow opaque references are used instead
	\item With opaque references, one can make queries to a datastructure on another machine
	\item Data must be in the same format for different operating systems and machines
	\enumstart
		\item Byte order (e.g. little endian vs. big endian)
		\item Data structures (e.g. trees need to be flattened)
	\enumend
	\item  Use an intermediate representation format (IRF) for data
	\enumstart
		\item Can be system dependent
		\item Transforming to IRF (aka marshalling, aka serializing
		\item Transforming from IRF (aka unmarshalling, aka deserializing)
	\enumend
	\item Interface definition language (IDL)
	\enumstart
		\item Independent on the programming language used
		\item Define service by name, input parameters, output parameters, \ddd
		\item An interface compiler generates stubs for servers and clients
	\enumend
	\item Binding (A server must be bound to an IP adress and port)
	\enumstart
		\item Can be done locally or distributed
		\item Options for distributed bind
		\enumstart
			\item Register (a server can register service names and the corresponding port)
			\item Withdraw (a server can annulatea service)
			\item Lookup (a client can ask the binder for address and port of a given service)
		\enumend
		\item There must be a way to locate the binder
		\item Clients usually cache binding informations
	\enumend
	\item Call semantics
	\enumstart
		\item Client makes RPC to a service, after a timeout, the server tries again or terminates
		\item Maybe: the procedure may have been executed or not (request or response message lost)
		\item At least once: the procedure may have been executed more than once (in some cases acceptable)
		\enumstart
			\item Messages need to be identifiable
			\item Messages should not be lost (resent until acknowledgement) \arrow persistence at sender
		\enumend
		\item At most once: the procedure may have been executed once or not at all
		\enumstart
			\item Messages need to be identifiable
			\item Needs duplicate detection
			\item Messages should not be delivered twice (resent until acknowledgement) \arrow persistence at receiver
		\enumend
	\enumend
	\item Advantages
	\enumstart
		\item A simple and efficient way to build distributed applications
		\item Fits well with the most typical programming languages
		\item Allows modular and hierarchical design
	\enumend
	\item Disadvantages
	\enumstart
		\item Not a standard \arrow different implementations of RPC
		\item Does not solve many problems, distribution creates
		\item Only client-server communication
	\enumend
	\item Limitations can be resolved by making the RPC transactional \arrow transaction manager
\enumend
