\enumstart
	\item Operational semantics
	\enumstart
		\item Describes execution on an abstract machine
		\item Focuses on how the program is evaluated/executed
		\item Two kinds
		\enumstart
			\item Natural semantics - coarse-grained view of execution
			\item Structural Operational semantics - fine-grained view of execution
		\enumend

	\item Denotional semantics
	\enumstart
		\item Programs are regarded as functions in a mathematical domain
		\item Describes only the effect, not how it is obtained
	\enumend
	\item Axiomatic semantics
	\enumstart
		\item Focuses on properties of interest, not on how computation happens
		\item Some aspects of the computation may be ignored
		\item Two kinds
		\enumstart
			\item Partial correctness
			\item Total correctness
