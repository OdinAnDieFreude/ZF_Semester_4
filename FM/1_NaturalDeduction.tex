		\item Rules
		\enumstart
			\item Are used to construct derivations under assumptions
			\item $A_1, \mathellipsis, A_n  \vdash A$ reads as "A follows from $A_1, \mathellipsis, A_n$"
		\enumend
		\item Derivations (are trees)
			\\ \image{example_derivation_tree.png}
		\item Proof of $A$ is a derivation tree with root $\vdash A$
		\item A sequent is an assertion (judgement) of the form: $A_1, \mathellipsis, A_n \vdash A$
		\item An axiom is a starting point for building derivation trees
		\item Two kinds of rules: introduction and elimination
