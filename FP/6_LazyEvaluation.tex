\section{Lazy Evaluation}
\enumstart
	\item Expressions only evaluated when necessary
	\item Substitution without argument evaluation
	\item Sometimes, expressions are never evaluated
	\item Duplicated computation avoided
	\item Implementation based on sharing: terms represented as directed acyclic graphs
	\item Functions are evaluated top-down (outermost operator first)
	\item Otherwise usually from left to right, but dependant on operator precedence
	\item Complexity can be better than exprected (head . isort executes in $\mathcal{O}(n)$, even though isort has complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$)
	\item Infinity data (data is created on demand)
	\item Lazy evaluation complicates analyzing program complexity and correctness
