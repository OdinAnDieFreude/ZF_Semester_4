\enumstart
	\item Virtualizes an entire (hardware) machine
	\enumstart
		\item Contrast with OS processes
		\item Interface provided is illusion of real hardware
		\item Terminology: guest operating system
	\enumend
	\item Usecases
	\enumstart
		\item Performance isolation
		\item Backward compatibility
		\item Cloud computing
		\item Running multiple OSes on one machine
		\item Server consolidation
		\item Resource isolation
		\item Operating system development

	\enumstart
		\item Difference
		\enumstart
			\item Creating an illusion of hardware to the "applications"

\subsection{Virtualizing the CPU}
\enumstart
	\item A CPU architecture is virtualizable if it can be perfectly emulated over itself, with all non-privileged instructions executed natively
	\item Privileged instructions \arrow trap
	\item x86 is not virtualizable \arrow emulation, paravitualization, binary rewriting, hardware support
\enumend

\subsection{Virtualizing the MMU and physical memory}
\enumstart
	\item Hypervisor allocates memory to VMs
	\item Guest virtual addresses \arrow hypervisor virtual addresses \arrow physical addresses
	\item virtualization modes
	\enumstart
		\item Direct writable page tables
		\item Shadow pagetables
		\enumstart
			\item Guest OS sets up its own pagetables, not used by hardware \arrow VMM maintains shadow page tables
			\item Maps directly from guest VAs to machine VAs \arrow hardware switched whenever guest reloads PTBR
			\item VMM must keep tables consistent
		\enumend
		\item Hardware assisted paging
	\enumend
	\item Paravitualization approach
	\enumstart
		\item Guest OS creates page tables, the hardware uses \arrow modification to guest OS
		\item VMM must check all writes to PTEs \arrow hyper call to update PTEs
	\enumend
	\item Nested page tables
	\item Memory allocation
	\enumstart
		\item Guest OS is not expected physical memory in size
		\item Hypervisor wants to overcommit RAM
		\item Double paging
		\item Ballooning
		\enumstart
			\item Technique to reclaim memory from guest
			\item Install a balloon driver in guest OS \arrow hyper calls
		\enumend
	\enumend

\subsection{Virtualizing devices}
\enumstart
	\item Trap-and-emulate
	\item Interrupts \arrow upcalls to guest OS
	\enumstart
		\item Emulate interrupt controller in guest
		\item Emulate DMA
		\item Paravirtualized: fake device driver \arrow hypercalls
	\enumend
\enumend

\subsection{Virtualizing the network}
\enumstart
	\item Hypervisor implements a soft switch (virtual network on a machine)
\enumend
