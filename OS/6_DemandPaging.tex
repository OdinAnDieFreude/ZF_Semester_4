\subsection{Uses for virtual memory}
\enumstart
	\item Process isolation
	\item IPC
	\item Shared code segments
	\item Program initialization
	\item Efficient dynamic memory allocation
	\item Cache management
	\item Program debugging
	\item Efficient I/O
	\item Memory mapped files
	\item Virtual memory
	\item Checkpoint and restart
	\item Persistent data structures
	\item Process migration
	\item Information flow control
	\item Distributed shared memory
	\item \ddd

\subsection{Copy-on-write (COW)}
\enumstart
	\item vfork
	\item Doesn't copy \arrow fast, dangerous (two writers to same heap)
	\item Solution: only copy when something is going to get written
	\item Step-by-step
	\enumstart
		\item Initially mark all pages as read only
		\item Either process writes \arrow page fault
		\enumstart
			\item Fault handler allocates new frame
			\item Makes copy of page in new frame
			\item Maps each copy in respective processes writeable
		\enumend
	\enumend
\enumend

\subsection{Demand paging}
\enumstart
	\item Bring page into memory only when it is needed \arrow less memory, less I/O, faster response
	\item Turn RAM into a cache for processes on disk
	\item Lazy swapper
	\enumstart
		\item Never swaps a page into memory unless page will be needed
		\item Swapper that deals with pages is a pager
		\item Can do this with segments, but more complex
	\enumend
	\item Strict demand paging: only page in when referenced
\enumend

\subsection{Page replacement}
\enumstart
	\item What happens, if no free frames available? \arrow discard a victim frame
	\item Try to pick a victim that won't be used in the future \arrow heuristics
	\item Use modify-bit on PTE \arrow prefere clean pages
	\item Goal: lowest page fault rate
	\item Belady's anomaly: It's possible to have more page faults with more frames
	\item Optimal: Replace page that will not be used for longest period of time
	\item Strategies
	\enumstart
		\item FIFO page replacement
		\item Least recently used (LRU) algorithm: use a stack to implement \arrow no bellady's anomaly
		\item Second chance algorithm: replace (e.g. LRU) if already tried to replace once
	\enumend
\enumend

\subsection{Frame allocation policies}
\enumstart
	\item Each process needs minimum number of pages
	\item Schemes
	\enumstart
		\item Fixed allocation
		\enumstart
			\item Equal allocation: all processes get equal share
			\item Proportional allocation: allocate according to the size of process
		\enumend
		\item Priority allocation
		\enumstart
			\item Proportional to priority rather than size
		\enumend
	\enumend
	\item Global replacement: process selects a replacement frame from the set of all frames
	\item Local replacement: process selects a replacement frame from it's own allocated frames
	\item If a process does not have enough frames \arrow thrashing
	\item Thrashing: thread is busy swapping pages in and out
	\item Working set model: $\sum$WorkingSet$_i >$Total number of pages \arrow thrashing
	\item Measure page-fault frequency: too high \arrow process gains frames, too low \arrow loses
\enumend
