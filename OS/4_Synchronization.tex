\section{Synchronization}

\subsection{Basic synchronization constructs}
\enumstart
	\item Disabling interrupts \arrow other processors could interfere
	\item Test-and-set (TAS): Atomically (read value of a memory location, set value to 1)
	\item Compare-and-swap (CAS)
	\item Load-link (LL), Store-conditional (SC)
	\enumstart
		\item LL: load from a location and mark as owned
		\item SC
		\enumstart
			\item Store only if marked by this processor
			\item Clear any marks set by other processors
			\item Return whether it worked
		\enumend
	\enumend
	\item Spinning (e.g. caused by TAS)
	\enumstart
		\item On a uniprocessor: pointless \arrow wait for an interrupt\ddd
		\item On a multiprocessor: only works if lock-hold is running on another core
	\enumend
\enumend

\subsection{Inter process communication (IPC) with shared memory}
\enumstart
	\item Constructs
	\enumstart
		\item Semaphores
		\item Mutexes
		\item Condition variables
		\item Monitors
	\enumend
	\item Interaction between scheduling and synchronization
	\item Priority inheritance
	\enumstart
		\item Process holding lock inherits priority of highest priority process, that is waiting for the lock
		\item Releasing lock \arrow priority goes back to normal value
		\item Alternative: Priority ceiling \arrow acquire priority of highest priority process that can ever hold lock
	\enumend
\enumend

\subsection{IPC without shared memory}
\enumstart
	\item Asynchronous (buffered) IPC
	\enumstart
		\item Receiver blocks, waiting for a message
		\item Sender does not block
	\enumend
	\item Synchronous (unbuffered) IPC
	\enumstart
		\item Sender blocks until receiver ready
	\enumend
	\item Duality of messages and memory: Any shared-memory system is equivalent to non-shared-memory system (claim by Lauer and Needham)
\enumend

\subsection{Advanced synchronization constructs}
\enumstart
	\item Pipes in UNIX
	\enumstart
		\item Unidirectional, buffered communication channel between 2 processes
	\enumend
	\item Messaging systems
	\enumstart
		\item Endpoints may or may not know each other
		\item Messages to multiple destinations
		\item Demultiplex multiple arriving messages
		\item Can't wait forever \arrow timeout
		\item Same as in networking
	\enumend
	\item Named pipes \arrow special file of type pipe(fifo) \arrow mkfifo
	\item Local RPC (can be made very fast, normally isn't)
	\item Unix signals \arrow asynchronous notification from the kernel
	\enumstart
		\item Some signals can be handled by the process
		\item Can be used like userspace traps
		\item If multiple signals of the same type are to be delivered \arrow only one is delivered
		\item If multiple signals of different type are to be delivered \arrow they are delivered in any order
		\item Specialized form of upcalls (kernel RPC to user process)
	\enumend
\enumend
