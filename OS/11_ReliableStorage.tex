\section{Reliable storage}
\enumstart
	\item Reliability: probability it will be reliable for some period of time
	\item Availability: probability, it is available at any given time
	\item Use transactions to ensure data is consistent
	\item Redundancy (e.g. RAID)
	\item Error correcting codes
	\item Remapping: identify bad sectors and avoid them
	\item Nonrecoverable error rates are significant
	\item Failures are not independent
	\item Error rates are not uniform
	\item Mean time to failure (MTTF)
\enumend

\subsection{Redundant array of independent disks}
\enumstart
	\item RAID 1: mirroring
	\item Parity disks
	\item RAID 5: rotating parity
	\item Recovery from crashes
	\enumstart
		\item Use non-volatile write buffer
		\item Tranactional update to blocks
		\item Recovery scan
		\item Do nothing
	\enumend
	\item Mean time to repair (MTTR)
	\item Mean time to data loss (MTTDL)
