\subsection{Conceptual model}
\enumstart
	\item Information requirements
	\item Book of duty: describes information requirements, processes, processing requirements 
\enumend

\subsection{Logical model}
\enumstart
	\item Relation: $R \subseteq E_1 \times E_2$
	\item Entity/relationship (ER) models
	\enumstart
		\item Entity (gegenstandstyp): square with text
		\item Relationship (beziehungstyp): diamond with text
		\item Attribute (eigenschaft): oval with not underlined text
		\item Key (identifikation): oval with underlined text
		\item Role: line with text
		\item Functionalities of binary relations: 1:1, 1:N, N:1, N:N
		\item Functionalities of $n$-ary relations
	\enumend
	\item Attribute vs. entity
	\enumstart
		\item Entity if the concept has more than one relationship
		\item Attribute if the concept has only one 1:1 relationship
	\enumend
	\item Partitioning of ER models
	\enumstart
		\item Most realistic models are larger than a page \arrow partition models
		\item Partition by domains
		\item No good automatic graph partitioning tool
	\enumend
	\item Good vs. bad models
	\enumstart
		\item Do not model redundancy or tricks to improve performance
		\item Less entries is better
		\item C4 rules (concise, correct, coplete, comprehensive)
	\enumend
	\item (min, max)-notation
	\item Weak entities: diamond, double frame, double line \arrow weak entity depends on strong entity
	\item Generalization: hexagon
	\item Aggregation: diamond with text "part-of"
	\item Limitations of ER
	\enumstart
		\item ER has no formal semantics
		\item No way to express relationships between sets of entities
		\item No way to express negative rules
	\enumend
	\item Data modeling in UML
	\enumstart
		\item Square for class
		\item Associations as lines (directed, undirected)
		\item Multiplicities
		\enumstart
			\item Exact multiplicities: x..y
			\item Flipped around as compared to ER
			\item Cannot be used for $n$-ary relationships
		\enumend
		\item Functionalities: 1, $*$, 1..$*$, 0..$*$, 0..1
		\item Aggregation
		\enumstart
			\item Soft aggregation: empty diamond before line
			\item Hard aggregation: filled diamond before line
		\enumend
		\item Generalization: triangle at line
	\enumend
